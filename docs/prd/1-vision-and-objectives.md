# 1. Vision and Objectives

## 1.1. Product Vision
Create a network of specialized and independent e-learning platforms (Schools), each with its own brand and domain, but all powered by a common LMS application and a robust ERPNext back-office. The project aims to offer a premium and targeted experience to students, away from generalist marketplaces.

## 1.2. Problem to Solve
Expert content creators need to launch online schools that reflect a strong and professional brand image in their niche. Marketplace-type platforms (like Udemy) dilute this brand image. This project offers a solution that combines brand autonomy and centralized code management efficiency.

## 1.3. Key Personas
* **The Administrator (You):** Manages all sites, creates course content, manages finances and the affiliate program.
* **The Student (Client):** Registers, purchases and follows courses within a specific school. Their experience is compartmentalized to that school.
* **The Influencer (Commercial Partner):** Promotes a school via links or coupons and tracks their performance and commissions via a dedicated portal.
