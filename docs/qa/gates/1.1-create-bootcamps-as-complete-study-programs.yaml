    title: 'Potential infinite recursion in save method'
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - 'Address the potential infinite recursion issue in the save method'
      - 'Add explicit input sanitization for user-provided data'
      - 'Make hardcoded values in item creation configurable'
    monitor:
      - 'Add performance monitoring for item creation and synchronization'
      - 'Monitor error rates related to bootcamp creation'

    location: 'apps/lms/lms/doctype/lms_bootcamp/lms_bootcamp.py'
    recommendation: 'Implement a flag to prevent recursive calls or restructure the logic'
  
  - type: RISK
    severity: HIGH
    description: 'Missing input sanitization (SEC-001)'
    location: 'apps/lms/lms/doctype/lms_bootcamp/lms_bootcamp.py'
    recommendation: 'Add explicit input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data'

    severity: MEDIUM
    description: 'Hardcoded values in item creation (OPS-001)'
    location: 'apps/lms/lms/doctype/lms_bootcamp/lms_bootcamp.py'
    recommendation: 'Make item_group and stock_uom configurable or derive from settings'
  
  - type: IMPROVEMENT
    severity: MEDIUM
    description: 'Potential performance issues with item sync (PERF-001)'
    location: 'apps/lms/lms/doctype/lms_bootcamp/lms_bootcamp.py'
    recommendation: 'Add checks to only synchronize when relevant fields have changed'

next_steps:
  - 'Address all HIGH severity issues before production deployment'
  - 'Consider implementing MEDIUM severity improvements in next iteration'
  - 'Run full test suite including edge cases and performance tests'
  - 'Review updated implementation with security team'
