## Detailed Risk Assessment

### Risk Matrix

| Risk ID | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-------------|--------|-------|----------|
| TECH-001 | Performance issues with large numbers of Pricing Rules | Low (1) | Low (2) | 2 | Minimal |
| TECH-002 | Edge cases in promo code validation and usage tracking | Low (1) | Low (2) | 2 | Minimal |
| UX-001 | UI may not be fully responsive on all devices | Low (1) | Low (1) | 1 | Minimal |
| SEC-001 | Potential security issues with access control bypass | Low (1) | Low (1) | 1 | Minimal |

### Risk Details

1. **TECH-001: Performance issues with large numbers of Pricing Rules (Score: 2)**
   - **Description**: For systems with many Pricing Rules, operations might become slow.
   - **Mitigation**: The current implementation is efficient for typical use cases. For extremely large numbers, indexing could be added.
   - **Testing Focus**: Performance testing with large numbers of Pricing Rules.

2. **TECH-002: Edge cases in promo code validation and usage tracking (Score: 2)**
   - **Description**: Complex scenarios with promo code validation and usage tracking might not be handled perfectly.
   - **Mitigation**: Current implementation handles most cases well. Additional testing for complex scenarios is recommended.
   - **Testing Focus**: Testing complex promo code validation and usage tracking scenarios.

3. **UX-001: UI responsiveness (Score: 1)**
   - **Description**: The UI implementation may not be fully optimized for all screen sizes.
   - **Mitigation**: The current implementation uses standard responsive classes. Additional testing on various devices is recommended.
   - **Testing Focus**: Cross-device testing.

4. **SEC-001: Security issues with access control bypass (Score: 1)**
   - **Description**: Potential for access control bypass if not properly implemented.
   - **Mitigation**: Current implementation has robust access control checks. Additional security review is recommended.
   - **Testing Focus**: Security testing with various user roles.
