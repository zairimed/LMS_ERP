## Detailed Risk Assessment

### Risk Matrix

| Risk ID | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-------------|--------|-------|----------|
| TECH-001 | Performance issues with large numbers of enrollments | Low (1) | Low (1) | 1 | Minimal |
| TECH-002 | Edge cases in lesson navigation (first/last lessons) | Low (1) | Low (1) | 1 | Minimal |
| UX-001 | UI may not be fully responsive on all devices | Low (1) | Low (1) | 1 | Minimal |
| SEC-001 | Potential security issues with access control bypass | Low (1) | Low (1) | 1 | Minimal |

### Risk Details

1. **TECH-001: Performance issues with large numbers of enrollments (Score: 1)**
   - **Description**: For users enrolled in many bootcamps, the "My Bootcamps" page might become slow.
   - **Mitigation**: Implemented pagination to limit the number of bootcamps displayed per page.
   - **Testing Focus**: Performance testing with users having many enrollments.

2. **TECH-002: Edge cases in lesson navigation (Score: 1)**
   - **Description**: Navigation buttons for previous/next lessons might not handle edge cases perfectly.
   - **Mitigation**: Current implementation handles most cases well. Additional testing for edge cases is recommended.
   - **Testing Focus**: Testing first and last lessons in courses.

3. **UX-001: UI responsiveness (Score: 1)**
   - **Description**: The UI implementation may not be fully optimized for all screen sizes.
   - **Mitigation**: The current implementation uses standard responsive classes. Additional testing on various devices is recommended.
   - **Testing Focus**: Cross-device testing.

4. **SEC-001: Security issues with access control bypass (Score: 1)**
   - **Description**: Potential for access control bypass if not properly implemented.
   - **Mitigation**: Enhanced security functions with input validation and error handling.
   - **Testing Focus**: Security testing with various user roles.

## Verification Summary

### 1. Access Control Implementation
