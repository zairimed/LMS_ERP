# Risk Profile: Story 1.1

Date: 2025-09-07
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 4
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 2
- Risk Score: 75/100 (calculated)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

No critical risks (score 9) were identified in this implementation.

## High Priority Risks

### 1. TECH-001: Potential infinite recursion in save method

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - The current implementation calls `self.save()` within the `after_insert` handler, which could potentially trigger the `on_update` handler and cause recursion.
**Impact**: High - Could cause system instability, excessive resource consumption, or data corruption.
**Mitigation**:
- Implement a flag to prevent recursive calls
- Restructure the logic to avoid calling save within the after_insert handler
- Add proper error handling to catch and handle recursion

**Testing Focus**: 
- Test the bootcamp creation process multiple times
- Test with various data inputs
- Monitor for signs of recursion during testing

### 2. SEC-001: Missing input sanitization

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - User input is not explicitly sanitized before being used to create ERPNext items.
**Impact**: Medium - Could potentially lead to data quality issues or minor security vulnerabilities.
**Mitigation**:
- Add explicit input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data
- Use Frappe's built-in validation functions where appropriate
- Sanitize text fields before using them in item creation

**Testing Focus**:
- Test with various input values including special characters
- Test with extremely long input values
- Test with SQL injection-like strings

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Category | Description                                 | Probability | Impact | Score | Mitigation Status |
|----------|----------|---------------------------------------------|-------------|--------|-------|-------------------|
| TECH-001 | Technical| Potential infinite recursion in save method | Medium (2)  | High (3)| 6    | Required          |
| SEC-001  | Security | Missing input sanitization                  | High (3)    | Medium (2)| 6  | Required          |
| PERF-001 | Performance| Potential performance issues with item sync| Medium (2)  | Medium (2)| 4  | Recommended       |
| OPS-001  | Operational| Hardcoded values in item creation         | Medium (2)  | Medium (2)| 4  | Recommended       |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- Test the bootcamp creation process to verify no infinite recursion occurs
- Test with various input values to ensure proper sanitization
- Verify that the item linking and synchronization works correctly

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- Test performance with bulk operations
- Test with various configurations for item_group and stock_uom
- Test error handling for edge cases

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests

- Standard functional tests for bootcamp creation
- Regression test suite for existing functionality

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- Address the potential infinite recursion issue in the save method
- Add explicit input sanitization for user-provided data
- Make hardcoded values configurable

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Performance optimizations can be implemented in a subsequent update
- Additional error handling can be added as needed

### Accepted Risks

No risks are being accepted at this time. All identified risks should be addressed before production deployment.

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Performance metrics for item creation and synchronization
- Error rates related to bootcamp creation
- Resource usage during bulk operations

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Architecture changes significantly
- New integrations with ERPNext are added
- Performance issues are reported
- Security vulnerabilities are discovered
