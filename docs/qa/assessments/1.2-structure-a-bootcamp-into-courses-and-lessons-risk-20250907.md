## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Category | Description                                 | Probability | Impact | Score | Mitigation Status |
|----------|----------|---------------------------------------------|-------------|--------|-------|-------------------|
| TECH-001 | Technical| Missing validation in Lesson content types  | Low (1)     | Medium (2)| 2  | Recommended       |
| OPS-001  | Operational| Lack of specific error messages           | Low (1)     | Low (1) | 1   | Recommended       |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

No critical risks identified.

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

No high risks identified.

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

1. Test different content types to ensure proper validation
2. Test the full hierarchy creation (Bootcamp -> Course -> Lesson)
3. Test the free preview functionality
4. Test edge cases and error conditions

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

No risks require immediate fixing before production.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- TECH-001: Missing validation in Lesson content types - Can be addressed in future iteration
- OPS-001: Lack of specific error messages - Can be addressed in future iteration

### Accepted Risks

No risks are being accepted at this time. All identified risks are low priority and can be addressed in future iterations.

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Error rates related to content type validation
- User feedback on error messages

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New content types are added
- User feedback indicates issues with validation or error messages
- Performance issues are reported
