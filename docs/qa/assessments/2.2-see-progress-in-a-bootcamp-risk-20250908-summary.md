### Detailed Risk Assessment

#### Risk Matrix

| Risk ID | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-------------|--------|-------|----------|
| TECH-001 | Performance issues with progress calculation for large bootcamps | Low (2) | Medium (3) | 6 | Low |
| TECH-002 | Incomplete handling of non-video content types for auto-completion | Low (1) | Low (2) | 2 | Minimal |
| UX-001 | UI may not be fully responsive on all devices | Low (2) | Low (2) | 4 | Low |
| OPS-001 | Lack of explicit error handling in template context generation | Low (1) | Low (1) | 1 | Minimal |

### Verification Summary

All critical functionality has been verified:
- Enrollment DocType with progress tracking
- Automatic video lesson completion
- Visual progress display UI
- Comprehensive test coverage

### Recommendations

1. **Performance Optimization**: Consider caching for very large bootcamps
2. **Extended Auto-completion**: Implement for other content types in future iterations
3. **Enhanced UI**: Add more visual indicators and motivational elements
4. **Accessibility**: Ensure UI meets accessibility standards

The feature is ready for production use with minor low-priority improvements suggested for future iterations.
