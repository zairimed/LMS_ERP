# Test Design: Story 1.1 - Create Bootcamps as Complete Study Programs

## Overview
This document outlines the test scenarios and approaches for validating the implementation of Story 1.1: "Create Bootcamps as Complete Study Programs".

## Test Objectives
1. Verify that LMS Bootcamp DocType can be created successfully
2. Verify that required fields are properly validated
3. Verify that ERPNext Items are automatically created and linked when Bootcamps are created
4. Verify that fields are properly synchronized between Bootcamps and their linked Items
5. Verify that the custom form template works correctly
6. Verify that edge cases and error conditions are handled gracefully

## Test Environment
- Frappe Framework v15.20.0
- ERPNext v15.20.0
- Python 3.x
- MariaDB 10.6

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Basic Bootcamp Creation
**Scenario**: Create a new LMS Bootcamp with valid data
**Preconditions**: 
- User has appropriate permissions to create LMS Bootcamps
**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to the LMS Bootcamp creation form
2. Enter valid data in all required fields (Title)
3. Enter optional data in other fields (Description)
4. Save the Bootcamp
**Expected Results**:
- Bootcamp is created successfully
- Bootcamp has a valid name
- All entered data is saved correctly

### 2. Bootcamp Validation
**Scenario**: Attempt to create a new LMS Bootcamp without required fields
**Preconditions**: 
- User has appropriate permissions to create LMS Bootcamps
**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to the LMS Bootcamp creation form
2. Leave the Title field empty
3. Enter optional data in other fields (Description)
4. Attempt to save the Bootcamp
**Expected Results**:
- System displays validation error
- Bootcamp is not created
- User is prompted to fill in required fields

### 3. Item Creation and Linking
**Scenario**: Verify that an ERPNext Item is automatically created and linked when a Bootcamp is created
**Preconditions**: 
- User has appropriate permissions to create LMS Bootcamps and Items
**Test Steps**:
1. Create a new LMS Bootcamp with valid data
2. Check that an Item field is populated in the Bootcamp
3. Verify that the linked Item exists in the Item list
4. Verify that the Item has the correct data (item_code, item_name, description)
**Expected Results**:
- Item field in Bootcamp is populated with a valid Item name
- Linked Item exists and has correct data

### 4. Item Synchronization
**Scenario**: Verify that changes to Bootcamp fields are synchronized to the linked Item
**Preconditions**: 
- A Bootcamp with linked Item exists
**Test Steps**:
1. Edit an existing LMS Bootcamp
2. Change the Title and Description fields
3. Save the Bootcamp
4. Check that the linked Item has been updated with the new data
**Expected Results**:
- Linked Item is updated with new Title and Description
- Changes are reflected immediately

### 5. Recursive Save Prevention
**Scenario**: Verify that the save method doesn't cause infinite recursion
**Preconditions**: 
- User has appropriate permissions to create LMS Bootcamps
**Test Steps**:
1. Create a new LMS Bootcamp
2. Monitor system for signs of recursion (excessive resource usage, multiple save operations)
3. Edit an existing LMS Bootcamp
4. Monitor system for signs of recursion
**Expected Results**:
- Bootcamp creation and editing complete without recursion
- System resources remain stable
- No excessive save operations occur

### 6. Input Sanitization
**Scenario**: Verify that user input is properly sanitized
**Preconditions**: 
- User has appropriate permissions to create LMS Bootcamps
**Test Steps**:
1. Create a new LMS Bootcamp with special characters in the Title and Description
2. Create a new LMS Bootcamp with SQL injection-like strings in the Title and Description
3. Create a new LMS Bootcamp with extremely long strings in the Title and Description
**Expected Results**:
- All Bootcamps are created successfully
- Special characters are handled properly
- SQL injection attempts are neutralized
- Long strings are handled within system limits

### 7. Form Template Functionality
**Scenario**: Verify that the custom form template works correctly
**Preconditions**: 
- A Bootcamp exists
**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to an existing Bootcamp
2. Verify that all fields are displayed correctly
3. Verify that the linked Item information is displayed
4. Verify that the Courses table is displayed
5. Verify that the Edit button works correctly
6. Verify that the View Linked Item button works correctly (if Item exists)
**Expected Results**:
- All fields are displayed correctly
- Linked Item information is displayed
- Courses table is displayed
- Buttons function correctly

### 8. Performance with Bulk Operations
**Scenario**: Verify that the system performs well with multiple Bootcamp creations
**Preconditions**: 
- User has appropriate permissions to create LMS Bootcamps
**Test Steps**:
1. Create multiple LMS Bootcamps in quick succession
2. Monitor system performance (response time, resource usage)
3. Verify that all Bootcamps are created successfully
**Expected Results**:
- All Bootcamps are created successfully
- Response time remains acceptable
- Resource usage stays within normal limits

## Edge Cases and Error Conditions

### 1. Duplicate Titles
**Test**: Attempt to create a Bootcamp with a title that already exists
**Expected**: System should handle duplicate titles appropriately (either allow with unique naming or show error)

### 2. Database Connection Issues
**Test**: Simulate database connection issues during Bootcamp creation
**Expected**: System should handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages

### 3. ERPNext Item Creation Failures
**Test**: Simulate failures during ERPNext Item creation
**Expected**: System should handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages

### 4. Permission Issues
**Test**: Attempt to create or edit Bootcamps without appropriate permissions
**Expected**: System should deny access and provide appropriate error messages

## Test Data Requirements

### Valid Test Data
- Titles with various lengths and characters
- Descriptions with various lengths and formatting
- Special characters in text fields
- Unicode characters in text fields

### Invalid Test Data
- Empty required fields
- SQL injection attempts
- Excessively long strings
- Invalid characters where applicable

## Automation Considerations
- Unit tests already exist and should be expanded to cover edge cases
- Integration tests should be created to verify the complete workflow
- Performance tests should be created for bulk operations
- Security tests should be created to verify input sanitization

## Success Criteria
- All functional requirements are met
- All acceptance criteria are satisfied
- All identified risks are mitigated
- All test scenarios pass
- Code quality meets project standards
- Documentation is complete and accurate
