## Dev Notes
### Data Models
- Enrollment DocType links a User to an LMS Bootcamp
- Enrollment document is created upon successful purchase
- Access control is based on the existence of an Enrollment document for a User and LMS Bootcamp pair
- Data model follows Frappe's DocType system [Source: docs/prd/4-data-model-blueprint.md, docs/fullstack_architecture/4-data-architecture.md]

### API Specifications
- Frappe automatically exposes REST API for all DocTypes
- Endpoints will be needed to retrieve enrolled bootcamp content
- Authentication will be managed by Frappe's standard system [Source: docs/fullstack_architecture/5-api-specification.md]

### Component Specifications
- Implementation will require both backend access control and frontend UI components
- UI will need to be designed for authenticated student users
- May need to create templates in the templates directory [Source: docs/fullstack_architecture/6-project-structure.md]

### File Locations
- Code should be created/modified in the lms application directory:
  - `apps/lms/lms/doctype/enrollment/` for access control logic
  - `apps/lms/lms/doctype/lms_bootcamp/` for content access logic
  - `apps/lms/lms/templates/` for UI components
  - Related tests should be in corresponding directories with a `test_` prefix [Source: docs/fullstack_architecture/6-project-structure.md]

### Testing Requirements
- All critical business logic must be covered by Python unit tests
- Backend code should be formatted with Black following PEP 8 standards [Source: docs/fullstack_architecture/7-coding-and-testing-standards.md]
- Special attention to testing access control to ensure proper security

### Technical Constraints
- Technology stack is based on Frappe v15.20.0 and ERPNext v15.20.0 [Source: docs/fullstack_architecture/3-technology-stack-tech-stack.md]
- Implementation must follow Frappe's DocType system for data modeling [Source: docs/fullstack_architecture/4-data-architecture.md]
- Access to bootcamp content is managed via Enrollment documents [Source: docs/prd/4-data-model-blueprint.md]

## Testing
### Testing Standards
- Test file location: In the same directory as the code being tested with a `test_` prefix
- Test standards: All critical business logic must be covered by Python unit tests
- Testing frameworks: Python Unit Tests integrated with Frappe
- Specific testing requirements for this story:
  - Test that only enrolled users can access bootcamp content
  - Test that users cannot access content for which they are not enrolled
  - Test the UI for navigating enrolled bootcamp content
  - Test the integration between purchase process and Enrollment document creation
