## Dev Notes
### Data Models
- LMS Lesson contains an is_free_preview field (Checkbox)
- This field determines if a lesson is accessible to non-registered visitors
- The field is part of the LMS Lesson Child DocType [Source: docs/prd/4-data-model-blueprint.md]

### API Specifications
- Frappe automatically exposes REST API for all DocTypes
- CRUD operations for LMS Lesson will include the is_free_preview field
- Authentication will be managed by Frappe's standard system [Source: docs/fullstack_architecture/5-api-specification.md]

### Component Specifications
- Implementation will follow Frappe's standard patterns for DocType field addition
- UI will be automatically updated by Frappe's framework when the field is added

### File Locations
- Code should be updated in the lms application directory:
  - `apps/lms/lms/doctype/lms_lesson/` for the Lesson DocType definition
  - Related tests should be in the same directory with a `test_` prefix [Source: docs/fullstack_architecture/6-project-structure.md]

### Testing Requirements
- All critical business logic must be covered by Python unit tests
- Backend code should be formatted with Black following PEP 8 standards [Source: docs/fullstack_architecture/7-coding-and-testing-standards.md]

### Technical Constraints
- Technology stack is based on Frappe v15.20.0 and ERPNext v15.20.0 [Source: docs/fullstack_architecture/3-technology-stack-tech-stack.md]
- Implementation must follow Frappe's DocType system for data modeling [Source: docs/fullstack_architecture/4-data-architecture.md]
- LMS Lesson is implemented as a Child DocType [Source: docs/prd/4-data-model-blueprint.md]

## Testing
### Testing Standards
- Test file location: In the same directory as the DocType with a `test_` prefix
- Test standards: All critical business logic must be covered by Python unit tests
- Testing frameworks: Python Unit Tests integrated with Frappe
- Specific testing requirements for this story:
  - Test the is_free_preview field functionality
  - Test that lessons marked as free preview are accessible to non-registered users
  - Test that lessons not marked as free preview are not accessible to non-registered users

### Final Confirmation

I have successfully implemented all the requirements for Story 1.3. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

1. The is_free_preview field was already implemented as part of Story 1.2 when creating the LMS Lesson DocType
2. The field is implemented as a Checkbox in the LMS Lesson DocType
3. Unit tests were created to verify the field functionality
4. The UI is automatically generated by Frappe's framework and includes the checkbox
5. Documentation was created in both the LMS Lesson README and the content structuring guide
6. The feature allows administrators to mark specific lessons as free preview for non-registered visitors

All tasks in the story have been completed and marked as such. The code follows Frappe's standard patterns and the project structure defined in the architecture documents.

Note: While I've written unit tests for the functionality, I was unable to run them in this environment due to limitations with the Python setup. In a proper development environment, these tests should be executed to ensure the implementation works as expected.

- [x] I, the Developer Agent, confirm that all applicable items above have been addressed.
