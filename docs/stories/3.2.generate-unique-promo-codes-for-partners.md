## Dev Notes
### Data Models
- Promo Codes will be implemented using ERPNext's Pricing Rules
- Pricing Rules will be extended to link to Sales Partners
- Pricing Rules already have validity date fields
- Data model follows Frappe's DocType system [Source: docs/prd/3-features-epics-user-stories.md]

### API Specifications
- Frappe automatically exposes REST API for all DocTypes
- CRUD operations for Pricing Rules will be available via standard endpoints
- Authentication will be managed by Frappe's standard system [Source: docs/fullstack_architecture/5-api-specification.md]

### Component Specifications
- Implementation will follow Frappe's standard patterns for DocType customization
- UI will be automatically updated by Frappe's framework when fields are added
- Pricing Rules is a standard ERPNext DocType, so much functionality already exists

### File Locations
- Code should be created/modified in the lms application directory:
  - `apps/lms/lms/doctype/pricing_rule/` for DocType customization
  - Related tests should be in the same directory with a `test_` prefix [Source: docs/fullstack_architecture/6-project-structure.md]

### Testing Requirements
- All critical business logic must be covered by Python unit tests
- Backend code should be formatted with Black following PEP 8 standards [Source: docs/fullstack_architecture/7-coding-and-testing-standards.md]

### Technical Constraints
- Technology stack is based on Frappe v15.20.0 and ERPNext v15.20.0 [Source: docs/fullstack_architecture/3-technology-stack-tech-stack.md]
- Implementation must follow Frappe's DocType system for data modeling [Source: docs/fullstack_architecture/4-data-architecture.md]
- Promo Codes will be implemented using ERPNext's Pricing Rules functionality [Source: docs/prd/3-features-epics-user-stories.md]

## Testing
### Testing Standards
- Test file location: In the same directory as the code being tested with a `test_` prefix
- Test standards: All critical business logic must be covered by Python unit tests
- Testing frameworks: Python Unit Tests integrated with Frappe
- Specific testing requirements for this story:
  - Test that promo codes can be created with links to Sales Partners
  - Test that validity dates are properly enforced
  - Test that promo codes can be tracked by partner
  - Test the customized Pricing Rule functionality
