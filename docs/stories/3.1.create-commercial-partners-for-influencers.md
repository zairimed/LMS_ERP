## Dev Notes
### Data Models
- Sales Partner is a standard ERPNext DocType
- Sales Partner is customized with a user field (Link to User) for portal access
- Sales Partner contains commission rate information (standard in ERPNext)
- Data model follows Frappe's DocType system [Source: docs/prd/4-data-model-blueprint.md, docs/fullstack_architecture/4-data-architecture.md]

### API Specifications
- Frappe automatically exposes REST API for all DocTypes
- CRUD operations for Sales Partner will be available via standard endpoints (e.g., `/api/resource/Sales Partner`)
- Authentication will be managed by Frappe's standard system [Source: docs/fullstack_architecture/5-api-specification.md]

### Component Specifications
- Implementation will follow Frappe's standard patterns for DocType customization
- UI will be automatically updated by Frappe's framework when fields are added
- Sales Partner is a standard ERPNext DocType, so much functionality already exists

### File Locations
- Code should be created/modified in the lms application directory:
  - `apps/lms/lms/doctype/sales_partner/` for DocType customization
  - Related tests should be in the same directory with a `test_` prefix [Source: docs/fullstack_architecture/6-project-structure.md]

### Testing Requirements
- All critical business logic must be covered by Python unit tests
- Backend code should be formatted with Black following PEP 8 standards [Source: docs/fullstack_architecture/7-coding-and-testing-standards.md]

### Technical Constraints
- Technology stack is based on Frappe v15.20.0 and ERPNext v15.20.0 [Source: docs/fullstack_architecture/3-technology-stack-tech-stack.md]
- Implementation must follow Frappe's DocType system for data modeling [Source: docs/fullstack_architecture/4-data-architecture.md]
- Sales Partner is a standard ERPNext DocType that will be customized [Source: docs/prd/4-data-model-blueprint.md]

## Testing
### Testing Standards
- Test file location: In the same directory as the code being tested with a `test_` prefix
- Test standards: All critical business logic must be covered by Python unit tests
- Testing frameworks: Python Unit Tests integrated with Frappe
- Specific testing requirements for this story:
  - Test that Sales Partners can be created with commission rates
  - Test that Users can be linked to Sales Partners
  - Test that proper permissions are set for linked Users
  - Test the customized Sales Partner functionality
